# What is GenAI?

Generative AI (GenAI) represents a significant leap forward in artificial intelligence technology. 
Unlike traditional AI systems that are primarily focused on analysis and prediction, GenAI can create 
new content, from text and images to code and music.

## Key Components

1. Large Language Models (LLMs)
2. Diffusion Models
3. Transformers Architecture

## Applications

- Content Creation
- Code Generation
- Image Synthesis
- Text-to-Speech
